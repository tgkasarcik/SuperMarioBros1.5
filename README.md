# *Super Mario Bros.* 1.5

*Super Mario Bros.* 1.5 is a re-creation and extension of the popular game *Super Mario Bros.* released by Nintendo in 1985.  This project was created throughout the Spring 2022 semester by a team of 6 Computer Science students from The Ohio State University in completion of course requirements.

## Copyright Note
*Super Mario Bros.* is a trademark of Nintendo Co., Ltd.  No copyright infringement is intended.  This project was created as an academic exercise in video game creation in completion of required coursework from The Ohio State University.  

## Original Features
### 4 Unique Envrionments
In *Super Mario Bros.* 1.5, Mario takes on 4 new worlds, ranging from a tropical paradise to a frigid tundra and finally culminating in the epic Ohio State v. Michigan showdown!

### Interactive Levels
Mario can now interact with each level in a new way by placing bricks!  Mario begins each level with a set amount of bricks.  Each time he breaks a brick, it is added to his inventory to be used later.  Mario can place bricks anywhere throughout each level, unlocking new exploration potential and gameplay strategies.

### Bounce Blocks
Mario can now soar through the sky on each level with the help of the new Bounce Block!  Inspired by Slime Blocks from *Minecraft*, Mario can use Bounce Blocks like a trampoline to jump to new heights never before possible.
